                    PHISHING DETECTION BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING.
                <p class="c2" style="font-size: 22px;word-spacing: 20px; font-weight: 100; ">Developed a machine learning model with supervised learning methods to identify phishing websites.
                    Classified websites as phishing or authentic by using features like SSL certificate, domain age, and URL
                    length.
                    Achieved 98% in phishing detection by employing thorough model evaluation and training using logistic
                    regression and multinomial-nb. </p>

                    BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING.
                <p class="c2" style="font-size: 22px;word-spacing: 20px; font-weight: 100;">Implemented a deep learning model to classify brain MRI images for tumor detection.
                    Preprocessed medical images and applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.
                    Evaluated model performance and achieved 92% in tumor detection, aiding in early diagnosis and
                    treatment planning. </p>
