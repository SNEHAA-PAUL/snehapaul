            <!-- <p class="pro_p">Welcome to my project portfolio. Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of my recent work, showcasing my skills
                in Python full-stack web development and other technologies.</p> -->

            <h2 class="pro_h2">ðŸ”¹Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning</h2>
            <p>As the team coordinator, I facilitated the project workflow and ensured cohesive teamwork. We began by collecting the necessary 
                data and conducting a comparative study on four neural networks: VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, and ResNet50. After preprocessing 
                the data, we performed segmentation using the watershed segmentation algorithm and applied Otsu's binary thresholding, along 
                with other morphological operations and edge detection to enhance the images.
                <br>
                Among the evaluated networks, DenseNet121 delivered the highest accuracy, while ResNet50 had the lowest. Based on our findings, 
                we developed a new efficient model called Genesis, introducing spatial attention and channel attention mechanisms to improve 
                feature extraction. Genesis achieved impressive results, with a training accuracy of 100% and a testing accuracy of 93%.</p>
            <p><strong>Future Goals : </strong>Our future goals for this project include improving data diversity, enhancing small lesion detection, exploring multi-task learning, integrating clinical information, validating in real-world settings, and enabling continual learning. Addressing these areas will advance the model's performance and practical utility, benefiting clinicians and patients in diagnosing and treating brain tumors.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used :</strong> Python, VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, ResNet50, Watershed Segmentation, Otsu's Binary 
                Thresholding, Morphological Operations, Edge Detection</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges : </strong>During the project, I ensured open communication and identified tasks crucial for prioritizing deliverables, helping us meet tight deadlines.</p>
            <p><strong>Teamwork : </strong>I actively participated in brainstorming sessions, supported my teammates, and contributed ideas and skills to achieve our goals. This reinforced the value of collective effort and effective communication.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2 class="pro_h2">ðŸ”¹Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>As the team leader, I spearheaded the project, ensuring smooth coordination and timely delivery. Our project involved 
                collecting data from Kaggle and performing feature extraction, focusing on four key features from the URL: Address Bar 
                Features, Abnormal Features, HTML-based Features, and Domain-based Features. We utilized a combination of URL parsing 
                libraries (like URLParse in Python) and HTML parsing libraries (like BeautifulSoup in Python) for feature extraction 
                from URLs and HTML content.
                <br>
                We cleaned the data to remove and identify null values and carried out feature engineering. For classification, we chose an 
                ensemble learning technique, using SVM-RBF and XG-Boost due to their superior performance and robustness. XG-Boost, with its 
                regularization parameter reducing variance and improving accuracy, achieved a high accuracy rate of about 97%. Additionally, 
                we used logistic regression and multinomial-nb for model evaluation and training.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used : </strong>Python, URLParse, BeautifulSoup, SVM-RBF, XG-Boost, Logistic Regression, Multinomial 
                Naive Bayes</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges : </strong>In this critical project with tight deadlines, I identified unseen issues and prioritized 
                deliverables by ensuring open communication with the team. This proactive approach enabled us to deliver the project on time.</p>
            <p><strong>Leadership : </strong>I effectively guided the team through various challenges, delegated tasks, ensured clear 
                communication, and maintained high morale. This experience underscored the importance of collaboration and strategic planning.</p>
